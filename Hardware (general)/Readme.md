### Devices

* Disable integrated audio device if you use an add-on soundcard, only Audio Pro's might need several soundcards for different out-/input devices.
* Disable all unused integrated peripherals (Network, Serial, Parallel Ports, etc.)
* Disable all unneeded running services (services.msc)


### Interrupts

[doctorzeus](https://forums.guru3d.com/members/doctorzeus.275790/) wrote a small utility called [MSIInturruptEnabler](https://github.com/TechtonicSoftware/MSIInturruptEnabler) to enable Message Signal Interrupts on GPU's under Windows. It requires admin rights to use it and a reboot after you applied the new changes.
