### Integrated Telemetry into games (e.g. DRM, Redshell & Co.)

Some games (not all) including copyright systems like Denuvo (DRM) or [Redshell](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQz1d2jf15nHZE8GaRDAWCVMWuYkhip_cwkDUD3fo9dn0EiDRG3crtNXNhPESz8ZLL2KVDULnm9D-VB/pubhtml) in order to spy/log the gamers activity which has an negative impact of the game performance itself ([longer loading times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByfLg9wGB4o), FPS drops or even crashes). A filter-list to prevent such stuff can be found [here](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList).

Keep in mind that [telemetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry) has (in normal cases) no affect on the gaming performance (if proper implemented) and you should consider to leave it enabled in order to help the game developers (e.g. for crash reports or to improve the anti-cheat mechanism) however, such systems scanning your entire OS and this might invade your privacy.

The most impact on the performance itself is done by the copyright-protection system and it's implementation and _can have_ a negative impact which results in longer loading times or _small_ FPS drops. The rumour that Denuvo cripples your performance is not _entirely_ true, it's depending on several factors in most cases you [lose around 2-3 FPS](https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/282924-denuvo-really-does-cripple-pc-gaming-performance) (which is considerable not "crippled" - depending how you see it).

My own advice is:
- Use GOG Versions (because they are DRM free)
- Play cracked versions (malware risk) or performance issue while "testing" it in a VM
- Check if there are _confirmed_ and _clean_ cracks from trusted groups which avoids losing performance via VM/Sandbox (as mentioned above) but the risk is still there that you get infected (via re-packs, drive-by, malvertising etc).
