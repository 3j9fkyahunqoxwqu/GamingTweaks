### DirectX Control Panel

Some old(er) Games (and Emulators) might suffering from and outdated Engine which aren't compatible anymore with the latest Windows 10 DirectX changes, the [DirectX Control Panel](http://www.sephiroth-j.de/1/downloads/diverses.php#windows_dxcpl) utility addresses some of those engine related problems which means you can for example re-enable Hardware Accelation functions on them. 

Another way (without utility) would to do this manually for every Game via Registry but this is in most of the cases too complicated and not necessary since the utility is freeware and small in size it should be no problem to dl and use it, in most of the cases the program still does it's job.
