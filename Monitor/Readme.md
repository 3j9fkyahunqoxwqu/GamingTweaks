### Monitor Overclocking

* [GamersNexus](https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/1674-overclock-monitor-higher-refresh-rate) has a nice guide to get started into the topic - worth to read!

Why overclock?
-------------

* Higher Refresh Rate(s)
* Custom Resolution
* Fix/Correct missing/wrong [EDID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Display_Identification_Data) values
* Correct/change or expand FreeSync range(s)
* _Smoother fps gameplay_


Possible Disadvantages
-------------

* Artifacts or no picture output 
* The settings you made must be imported and applies manually after each new driver installation
* Skipped frames (even if the monitor accepted the new values and everything seems "fluid")
* HDCP might break/DRM fails
* Color _might be_ changed after applying the changes use [Color Sustainer](http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/color-sustainer-download.html) to correct this


Possible Risks?
-------------

**None** (!), every change is temporarily until you approved the change. You can import/export profiles and backup the current states before you do any serious change. The hardware itself will not be affected in case something went wrong.
